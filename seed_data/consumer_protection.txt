**Description:**
Section 2(7) defines "consumer" as the cornerstone of consumer protection law. A consumer is any person who buys goods or services in exchange for consideration and utilizes such goods and services for personal use and not for the purpose of resale or commercial use. The definition is broad and inclusive, covering all types of buyers including those using electronic means, direct selling, teleshopping, and multi-level marketing.

The definition explicitly excludes persons who obtain goods for resale or for any commercial purpose. This ensures that the consumer protection framework benefits only end-users, not commercial traders. The Act extends to online transactions, making it highly relevant in the digital economy.

2. Excludes persons buying for resale or commercial purposes

   - If mediation fails, case returns for adjudication
   - Statements made during mediation cannot be used as evidence

**Practical Examples:**
- Consumer claims refrigerator is defective, company offers replacement, mediation helps agree on upgraded model plus compensation - Settled through mediation

=== CPA Section 82-87: Product Liability ===

**Section Number:** Sections 82 to 87 (Chapter VI)
**Act Name:** Consumer Protection Act, 2019
**Law Type:** Consumer Rights / Civil Law
**Subject:** Product liability and manufacturer responsibility

**Description:**
Chapter VI (Sections 82-87) introduces product liability provisions for the first time in Indian consumer law. Product liability makes manufacturers, service providers, and sellers strictly liable for harm caused by defective products or deficient services. A consumer can bring a product liability action if a product contains a manufacturing defect, design defect, fails to conform to express warranty, or lacks adequate usage instructions.

Product liability shifts burden of proof and creates accountability throughout the supply chain. It recognizes that consumers cannot always prove manufacturer negligence, so liability is imposed based on the defect itself.

**Grounds for Product Liability (Section 84):**

1. **Manufacturing Defect:**
   - Product deviates from manufacturing specifications
   - Defect in production process
   - Example: Car with faulty brake system due to assembly error

2. **Design Defect:**
   - Product designed in a manner that is unsafe
   - Even perfect manufacturing cannot eliminate danger
   - Example: Child toy with small detachable parts posing choking hazard

3. **Deviation from Manufacturing Specifications:**
   - Product does not conform to stated standards
   - Example: Helmet that does not meet IS safety standards

4. **Express Warranty Violation:**
   - Product fails to meet express warranty claims
   - Example: Air conditioner advertised to cool room in 5 minutes takes 30 minutes

5. **Inadequate Instructions or Warnings:**
   - Product lacks proper usage instructions
   - No warning about potential risks
   - Example: Electrical appliance without voltage specifications or safety warnings

**Liability of Different Parties:**

1. **Product Manufacturer (Section 84):**
   - Strictly liable for any of the above defects
   - Liable even if not negligent or fraudulent
   - Cannot escape liability by proving reasonable care was taken

2. **Product Seller (Section 85):**
   - Liable if seller has failed to exercise due care
   - If manufacturer cannot be identified or has no presence in India
   - If product has been altered or improperly stored by seller

3. **Product Service Provider (Section 86):**
   - Liable for providing deficient service
   - Liability for harm caused by service deficiency
   - Example: Hospital providing wrong treatment, mechanic's faulty repair

**Exceptions to Product Liability (Section 87):**

Product liability action cannot be brought if:
- Product misused, altered, or modified by consumer
- Product used after expiry date shown on packaging
- Defect did not exist when product left manufacturer's control
- Consumer was aware of defect and still voluntarily used product

**Practical Examples:**
- Pressure cooker explodes due to manufacturing defect, causing severe burns - Manufacturer strictly liable for compensation
- Pharmaceutical company sells medication with inadequate warning about side effects, consumer suffers harm - Manufacturer liable for design defect (inadequate warning)
- E-commerce platform sells counterfeit electronics under unknown brand, product catches fire - E-commerce platform (product seller) liable
- Automobile manufacturer's car model has design defect in airbag deployment system - Manufacturer liable for design defect even without negligence
