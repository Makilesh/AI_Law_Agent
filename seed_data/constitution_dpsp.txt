=== Article 44: Uniform Civil Code ===

**Article Number:** Article 44
**Part:** Part IV - Directive Principles of State Policy
**Subject:** Uniform civil code for all citizens

**Constitutional Text:**
"The State shall endeavour to secure for the citizens a uniform civil code throughout the territory of India."

**Principle:**
Article 44 directs the State to work towards enacting a uniform civil code applicable to all citizens regardless of religion. A uniform civil code would mean one law for all citizens in matters of marriage, divorce, inheritance, adoption, and succession.

**Current Status:**
India does not have a uniform civil code. Different personal laws apply to different religious communities:
- Hindus: Hindu Marriage Act, Hindu Succession Act, Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act
- Muslims: Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act
- Christians: Indian Christian Marriage Act, Indian Divorce Act, Indian Succession Act
- Parsis: Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act

**Exceptions (Uniform Laws):**
- Goa: Goa has uniform civil code inherited from Portuguese rule
- Special Marriage Act, 1954: Provides secular marriage option for all religions

**Debates and Controversies:**
**Arguments For Uniform Civil Code:**
- Promotes national integration and unity
- Ensures gender justice (many personal laws discriminate against women)
- Treats all citizens equally regardless of religion
- Simplifies legal system
- Removes anomalies in personal laws

**Arguments Against:**
- Violates religious freedom (Article 25)
- Diversity is India's strength, personal laws respect pluralism
- Sensitive issue requiring consensus
- Constitutional framers deliberately made it non-justiciable to allow gradual evolution

**Judicial Pronouncements:**
Supreme Court has repeatedly urged Parliament to enact uniform civil code:
- Mohd. Ahmed Khan v. Shah Bano Begum (1985): SC upheld Muslim woman's right to maintenance under CrPC despite Muslim personal law
- Sarla Mudgal v. Union of India (1995): SC called for UCC to prevent bigamy by conversion
- John Vallamattom v. Union of India (2003): SC reiterated need for UCC

**Partial Reforms:**
- Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986
- Triple Talaq banned by Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019
- Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005: Equal inheritance rights for daughters

**Practical Examples:**
- Hindu man cannot marry second time without divorcing first wife (Hindu Marriage Act prohibits bigamy), but Muslim man can marry up to 4 wives (under Muslim personal law) - Different laws for different religions
- Hindu daughter gets equal share in ancestral property (after 2005 amendment), but Muslim daughter gets half of son's share (under Shariat) - Gender discrimination in personal laws
- Christian couples need court approval for divorce, Hindu couples can divorce by mutual consent - Different divorce procedures
- In Goa, all citizens follow same civil code for marriage, divorce, succession regardless of religion - Uniform law example

**Related Articles:**
- Article 25-28: Freedom of religion (Fundamental Rights)
- Article 13: Laws inconsistent with Fundamental Rights void
- Article 14, 15: Equality (Fundamental Rights)

**Important Notes:**
- Article 44 is non-justiciable, so courts cannot force State to enact UCC
- UCC is political and social issue requiring consensus
- Some personal law reforms have been achieved through legislation
- Balance needed between religious freedom and gender justice/national integration
