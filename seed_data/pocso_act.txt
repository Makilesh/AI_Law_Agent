=== POCSO Section 2(1)(d): Child Defined ===

**Section Number:** Section 2(1)(d)
**Act Name:** Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012
**Law Type:** Criminal Law - Child Protection
**Subject:** Definition of child

**Description:**
Section 2(1)(d) of the POCSO Act defines "child" to mean any person below the age of 18 years. This definition is crucial as it determines the applicability of the Act's protective provisions. The POCSO Act provides enhanced protection and stringent punishment specifically for offenses committed against persons below 18 years of age.

The age of 18 is aligned with international standards and India's Juvenile Justice Act. If the victim is below 18 years, POCSO Act applies mandatorily, and the accused cannot claim consent as a defense, as a child is legally incapable of consenting to sexual acts.

**Key Elements:**
1. Age threshold: Below 18 years (up to 17 years, 364 days)
2. Gender-neutral: Applies to boys and girls equally
3. No consent defense: Child cannot consent to sexual acts
4. Age determination: Medical examination if age uncertain
5. Victim protection: Identity protected throughout proceedings

**Application Examples:**
- 17-year-old girl sexually assaulted - POCSO applies (child victim)
- 16-year-old boy subjected to sexual harassment - POCSO applies (gender-neutral)
- 14-year-old in "consensual" relationship with 25-year-old - POCSO applies, consent irrelevant, 25-year-old liable
- Person claims victim is 18 but medical examination shows 17 - POCSO applies based on medical age determination
- 18-year-old victim - POCSO does not apply, BNS sexual offense provisions apply

**Age Determination:**
- If age disputed, court orders medical examination
- Medical opinion considered along with other evidence (birth certificate, school records)
- Benefit of doubt given to victim
- Ossification test, dental examination used for age estimation

**Related Sections:**
- POCSO Section 3-15: Various offenses against children
- BNS Section 63-70: Sexual offenses (apply if victim is 18 or above)
- Juvenile Justice Act: Child in conflict with law (also uses 18 years threshold)

**Important Notes:**
- POCSO Act takes precedence over BNS/IPC when victim is a child
- Mistake of age is not a defense if reasonable inquiry not made
- Even if child looks mature or claims to be 18, onus is on accused to verify
- Child pornography and related offenses also covered under this definition

Section 4 prescribes rigorous imprisonment for not less than 10 years, which may extend to life imprisonment, along with a fine.

The offense is defined broadly to cover all forms of penetrative acts, recognizing that children need maximum protection from such invasive violations. The minimum sentence of 10 years (increased from 7 years in 2019 amendment) reflects the gravity of the offense.

=== POCSO Section 28-29: Special Courts and Presumptions ===

**Description:**
Section 28 mandates the establishment of Special Courts in each district to try POCSO offenses. Section 29 creates legal presumptions that aid prosecution by shifting certain burdens of proof to the accused. These provisions ensure speedy, specialized, and victim-friendly adjudication of child sexual abuse cases.

**Special Courts (Section 28):**

**Establishment:**
- State Government, in consultation with Chief Justice of High Court, designates a Sessions Court as Special Court for each district
- May designate more than one Special Court depending on caseload

Section 29 provides that in prosecution for any offense under the POCSO Act which requires culpable mental state on the part of the accused, the Special Court shall presume the existence of such mental state. The burden shifts to the accused to prove that they did not have the requisite culpable mental state.

**What This Means:**
- Prosecution does not need to prove accused had sexual intent or knowledge
- Court presumes accused had requisite intent if act is proved

**Related Sections:**

- BNSS: Criminal procedure provisions applicable

**Important Notes:**
