This is one of the most important provisions of the DV Act as it recognizes that a woman has the right to reside in the shared household regardless of whether she has any legal or equitable interest (ownership) in the property.

The residence order ensures that the aggrieved person is not dispossessed or disturbed from the shared household and can continue to reside there even if she does not own the property.

Critical principle: Woman's right to reside in shared household exists regardless of:

=== DV Act General Provisions: Rights, Remedies, and Support System ===

**2. Right to Reside in Shared Household:**
- Woman has right to reside in shared household regardless of ownership
- Right exists even if property belongs to husband's family
