=== SC/ST Act Section 18: Anticipatory Bail Not Available ===

**Section Number:** Section 18
**Act Name:** SC and ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989
**Law Type:** Criminal Law - Social Justice
**Subject:** Prohibition of anticipatory bail

**Description:**
Section 18 explicitly excludes the application of Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), which provides for anticipatory bail (now Section 482 of BNSS). This means that a person accused of an offense under the SC/ST Act cannot seek anticipatory bail (pre-arrest bail) from any court.

The prohibition is based on the rationale that caste-based atrocities are serious offenses requiring strict deterrence, and allowing anticipatory bail would defeat the purpose of the Act by enabling powerful accused to evade arrest and intimidate victims.

**Key Provisions:**

1. **No Anticipatory Bail:** Section 438 CrPC (Section 482 BNSS) shall not apply to accused of offense under SC/ST Act
2. **Arrest Without Warrant:** Police can arrest accused without warrant (cognizable offense)
3. **Regular Bail:** Accused can apply for regular bail after arrest under Section 437 CrPC (Section 483 BNSS)

**Supreme Court Interpretation:**

The Supreme Court has held that:
- Prohibition on anticipatory bail applies only if prima facie case is established
- If complaint does not disclose prima facie case under SC/ST Act, anticipatory bail can be granted
- Courts must examine if ingredients of SC/ST Act offense are satisfied before denying anticipatory bail
- Mechanical denial of anticipatory bail without examining prima facie case is wrong

**Practical Examples:**
- SC person files complaint under Section 3(1)(xi) for casteist insult, accused seeks anticipatory bail - Not available if prima facie case
- Person accused of atrocity under Section 3, applies for anticipatory bail - High Court/Sessions Court must refuse if prima facie case
- Complaint filed against person under SC/ST Act but no prima facie case made out - Court may grant anticipatory bail
- Person arrested for Section 3(1)(v) offense (land dispossession), applies for regular bail after arrest - Can apply for regular bail under CrPC/BNSS

**Related Sections:**
- BNSS Section 482: Anticipatory bail provision (not applicable to SC/ST Act)
- BNSS Section 483: Regular bail provision (applicable after arrest)
- SC/ST Act Section 3: Offenses (triggering anticipatory bail bar)
- SC/ST Act Section 18A: Procedure for arrest

**Important Notes:**
- 2018 Amendment removed the requirement of preliminary inquiry before arrest
- Police can arrest without obtaining prior approval (2018 Amendment)
- Regular bail can be sought after arrest
- Denial of anticipatory bail not automatic - prima facie case must exist
- Burden on prosecution to show prima facie case for denying anticipatory bail
