=== Contract Act Section 2(h): Definition of Contract ===

**Section Number:** Section 2(h)
**Act Name:** Indian Contract Act, 1872
**Law Type:** Commercial and Civil Law
**Subject:** What constitutes a contract

**Legal Definition:**
"An agreement enforceable by law is a contract."

**Explanation:**
A contract is an agreement that creates legal obligations between parties. For an agreement to become a contract, it must be enforceable by law, meaning if one party fails to perform, the other can seek legal remedy. Not all agreements are contracts - only those that satisfy the requirements of Section 10 are enforceable contracts.

**Key Elements:**
1. Agreement (offer + acceptance)
2. Enforceable by law
3. Creates legal obligations
4. Breach leads to legal remedy

**Contract vs Agreement:**
- Agreement: Meeting of minds, may or may not be enforceable
- Contract: Agreement + enforceability by law

**Practical Examples:**
- A agrees to sell his car to B for ₹5 lakhs, B accepts - Agreement becomes contract (enforceable)
- Father promises to give ₹10,000 to son if he tops class - Social/domestic agreement, not enforceable contract
- Company agrees to supply goods to buyer for agreed price - Commercial contract (enforceable)
- Invitation to dinner is accepted - Social agreement, not contract

**Related Sections:**
- Section 10: What agreements are contracts
- Section 2(a): Offer/Proposal
- Section 2(b): Acceptance
- Section 2(e): Agreement defined

**Important Notes:**
- All contracts are agreements, but not all agreements are contracts
- Enforceability is essence of contract
- Void agreements (Section 23-30) are not contracts
- Voidable contracts (Section 19) are contracts until avoided

**Section Number:** Section 10
**Act Name:** Indian Contract Act, 1872
**Law Type:** Commercial and Civil Law
**Subject:** Requirements for valid contract

**Legal Text:**
"All agreements are contracts if they are made by the free consent of parties competent to contract, for a lawful consideration and with a lawful object, and are not hereby expressly declared to be void."

**Six Essentials of Valid Contract:**

**1. Offer and Acceptance (Agreement):**
- There must be a lawful offer by one party
- Lawful acceptance of that offer by other party
- Offer and acceptance must create agreement

**2. Intention to Create Legal Relations:**
- Parties must intend legal consequences
- Social and domestic agreements usually lack this intent
- Commercial agreements presumed to have this intent

**3. Lawful Consideration:**
- Something in return (quid pro quo)
- Can be money, goods, services, or forbearance
- Must be lawful (not forbidden by law)
- Need not be adequate but must exist

**4. Capacity of Parties:**
- Parties must be competent to contract (Section 11)
- Minors, persons of unsound mind, persons disqualified by law cannot contract

**5. Free Consent:**
- Consent must be free from coercion, undue influence, fraud, misrepresentation, mistake
- Vitiated consent makes contract voidable (Section 19)

**6. Lawful Object:**
- Purpose of contract must be lawful
- Not forbidden by law, not fraudulent, not immoral, not opposed to public policy

**Additionally:**

- Landlord agrees to rent flat to tenant for ₹20,000/month - Valid contract

**Invalid Contracts:**

- Section 11: Who are competent to contract
- Section 13: Consensus ad idem (meeting of minds)
- Section 14: Free consent

**5. Mistake (Section 20-22):**
- **Mistake of Fact:** Bilateral mistake of fact material to contract makes it void
- **Mistake of Law:** Mistake of Indian law is no excuse; mistake of foreign law is mistake of fact
- Example: Both parties believe goods are of particular quality but actually different quality - Bilateral mistake of fact, void

**Effect of Vitiated Consent:**

**Coercion, Undue Influence, Fraud, Misrepresentation (Section 19, 19A):**

**Mistake:**
- Both A and B believe cow is alive but it had died before contract - Bilateral mistake of fact, void
- A believes land is exempt from tax (Indian law), enters into contract - Mistake of law, not excuse, valid contract
- A believes B is famous artist and contracts for painting, but B is someone else - Mistake as to identity, void

**Related Sections:**
- Section 10: Free consent is essential
- Section 64, 65: Rescission and restitution

- BNS: Offenses like fraud, cheating

**Important Notes:**
